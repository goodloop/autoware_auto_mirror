# Autoware.Auto

[Autoware](https://www.autoware.org/) is the world's first "all-in-one" open-source
software for self-driving vehicles hosted under the Autoware Foundation. Based on
[ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/).

Autoware.Auto as one of the projects of Autoware Foundation is a clean slate rewrite
of [Autoware.AI](https://autoware.ai/). Compared to Autoware.AI, Autoware.Auto has
best possible software engineering practices which includes PR reviews, PR builds,
100% documentation, 100% code coverage, style guide, development and release process, â€¦

It also does two more things differently: a) we have crisply defined interfaces for
different modules (messages and APIs) and  b) architecture designed for determinism
such that it is possible to reproduce behaviors on live and development machines.

# Use Cases
Autoware.Auto will initially address the following 2 use case:
1. Autonomous Valet Parking
1. Autonomous Depot Maneuvering

After the initial set of [milestones](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/milestones)
will be completed, Autoware.Auto will allow you to easily map a parking lot, create
a map for autonomous driving and drive over this parking lot entirely autonomously
in less than 2 weeks.
