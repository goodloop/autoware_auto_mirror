## Map Publisher

[NDTMapPublisherNode](@ref autoware::localization::ndt_nodes::NDTMapPublisherNode) is responsible for providing point cloud map data to recipients and publishing the "earth->map" transform. It does this by reading from a `.yaml` file, which contains the filename of a `.pcd` point cloud map as well as the map origin in geocentric coordinates (latitude, longitude and elevation). The transform is constructed using GeographicLib library and published as a static transform. The node reads the  point cloud file from disk,
 and transforms the point cloud into an ndt map (voxel and covariances) and then publishes this map. The node also converts the map data into a point cloud suitable for visualization in rviz2, and publishes this point cloud.

Since the file IO means that this node cannot be used in a real time context, the dependency constraints are more relaxed and
 [pcl](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) is used for reading and writing of `.pcd` files.

### Algorithm Design
The workflow of the publisher can be summarized as the following:
1. Wait to discover recipients of either the ndt map or the point cloud for visualization.
2. Use yaml-cpp to read a `.yaml` file containing a `.pcd` file name and the origin of the point cloud map in geocentric coordinates (lat, lon, evelation).
3. Using the GeogrpahicLib library, convert the geocentric cooordinates into an ECEF coordinates and publish as the static transform between frames `earth` and `map`.
4. Use [pcl](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) to read a `.pcd` file into a `sensor_msgs::msg::PointCloud2` message.
5. Transform the read point cloud into an ndt map using [DynamicNDTMap](@ref autoware::localization::ndt::DynamicNDTMap).
6. Serialize the ndt map representation into a `PointCloud2` message where each point represents a single cell in the ndt map.
7. Publish the resulting `PointCloud2` message containing the ndt map.
8. Convert the point cloud into a `sensor_msgs::msg::PointCloud2` with a Point type suitable to be received by rviz2.
9. Publish the resulting `PointCloud2` message containing the full point cloud

The published ndt map point cloud message has the following fields:

```
name = "x",        count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "y",        count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "z",        count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cov_xx",   count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cov_xy",   count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cov_xz",   count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cov_yy",   count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cov_yz",   count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cov_zz",   count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT64
name = "cell_id",  count = 2U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::UINT32
```

`cell_id` has a count of `2U` meaning it is practically an `unsigned int[2]`. This was necessary to represent 64 bit voxel indices since `sensor_msgs::msg::PointField` struct does not support 64 bit integer types.

The published point cloud message of the full point cloud has the following fields:

```
name = "x",        count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT32
name = "y",        count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT32
name = "z",        count = 1U,     datatype = sensor_msgs::msg::PointField::FLOAT32
```
The launch file for this node also launches a `voxel_grid_node` to subsample the published full point cloud to reduce the number of points to be visualized.
