filter_node_base {#filter-node-base-package-design}
===========

This is the design document for the `filter_node_base` package.


# Purpose / Use cases
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - Why did we implement this feature? -->


# Design
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - How does it work? -->


## Assumptions / Known limits
<!-- Required -->

* No transformation of frames is required to be done by the filter since this will be handled by an external node purely for transforming topics.

## Inputs / Outputs / API
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - How do you use the package / API? -->


## Inner-workings / Algorithms
<!-- If applicable -->


## Error detection and handling
<!-- Required -->


# Security considerations
<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
- Spoofing (How do you check for and handle fake input?)
- Tampering (How do you check for and handle tampered input?)
- Repudiation (How are you affected by the actions of external actors?).
- Information Disclosure (Can data leak?).
- Denial of Service (How do you handle spamming?).
- Elevation of Privilege (Do you need to change permission levels during execution?) -->
