euclidean_cluster_nodes {#euclidean-cluster-nodes-design}
=======================

# Purpose / Use cases

An autonomous driving stack needs some notion of where (hittable) objects are in Cartesian space.
This is necessary so that planners (e.g. motion, behavior) can plan safe trajectories and behaviors
that do not result in anything dangerous occurring, such as hitting an object.

The
[euclidean clustering](@ref autoware::perception::segmentation::euclidean_cluster::EuclideanCluster)
algorithm aggregate non-ground points into logical clusters, which roughly represent an object.
These clusters can be used directly or converted to an intermediate representation for further use.

The euclidean clustering algorithm for object detection must be wrapped in a node to communicate
and integrate with a larger system or stack.

# Design

As a terminal algorithm in a stack, the euclidean clustering algorithm should be highly configurable
as many behaviors are allowed and permissible. In particular, switches or configurations should
permit the following behaviors:

1. Accept inputs (i.e. PointCloud2)
2. Optionally apply downsampling to the input
3. Clustering is assumed to happen in all cases
4. Optionally publish the resulting clusters
5. Optionally compute and publish bounding boxes around the clusters as either `DetectedObjects` 
   type of `BoundingBoxArray` type
6. Optionally apply aggressive downsampling (or not) and ignore the z direction entirely

## Assumptions / Known limits

The euclidean cluster node assumes a bounded capacity. If this capacity
is overrun, then an exception will be thrown, dropping the current frame.

If an exception is thrown during the bounding box/hull formation process, then the box
in the process of being formed will be lost.

The block version has no frame information, and as such assumes that all of the input
data comes from the same coordinate frame.

Currently, this component is not static because the following subcomponents are not static:
- spatial_hash (euclidean clustering algorithm)
- voxel_grid
- Node pub/sub

## Inputs / Outputs / API

As a node, this component's API is largely expressed by interprocess communication handles,
e.g. topics. For more details on the API, see the
[docs](@ref autoware::perception::segmentation::euclidean_cluster).

### Inputs

The euclidean cluster nodes as a family accept one input: non-ground points as a
PointCloud2 message.

### Outputs

Any combination of the following two outputs are allowed (except using neither):

1. [PointClusters](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/autoware_auto_msgs/-/raw/master/autoware_auto_msgs/msg/PointClusters.msg)
2. [BoundingBoxArray](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/autoware_auto_msgs/-/raw/master/autoware_auto_msgs/msg/BoundingBoxArray.msg) or 
   [DetectedObjects](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/autoware_auto_msgs/-/raw/master/autoware_auto_msgs/msg/DetectedObjects.msg)

The former represents the raw clustering output of the object detection algorithm.

The latter represents the processed output of the resulting clusters, which is somewhat
more compact and simpler to interpret and handle.

The latter is provided for the purposes of memory efficiency.

### Parameters
- `use_detected_objects` - When true the node publishes bounding boxes as a `DetectedObjects` msg
- `use_cluster` - When true the node publishes clusters as `PointClusters` msg; otherwise, clusters are not published
- `use_box` - When true clusters are formed into a shape and published as a msg; Note: At least one of `use_cluster`, `use_box` and `use_detected_objects` has to be set to true
- `max_cloud_size` - Maximum number of points expected in the input point cloud. Used to preallocate internal types  
- `downsample` - Parameter to control whether to downsample the input point cloud using a voxel grid. If this is set to true, a set of `voxel` parameters need to be defined  
- `use_lfit` - When true `L-fit` method of fitting a bounding box to cluster will be used; otherwise, `EigenBoxes` method will be used  
- `use_z` - When true height of bounding boxes will be estimated; otherwise, height will be set to zero 

In addition to the above params, `cluster` parameters are also needed to run this node and `voxel` parameters may also be needed depending on `downsample` param.

## Error detection and handling

In general, exceptions are thrown if something unexpected happens.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

1. If an exception is thrown due to an `std::length_error`, i.e. the underlying data structure hit
capacity, then the clustering process immediately starts
2. If during the clustering process an error occurs, e.g. the maximum number of clusters would be
exceeded, then an exception is thrown only after the clustering process and publishing

The reasons for these exceptions is because while the clustering algorithm and its result
may not be in a good state, there is still validity to the information, if incomplete. As such,
the most recent information should be made available, and hopefully tracking should cover any gaps.
