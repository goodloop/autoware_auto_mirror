    :param checkers: An array of launch.actions representing the checker processes that will test
    the ROS ouput of the test_nodes

    Checkers can be created using the lidar_integration.make_pcl_checker factory function.  One
    checker is expected for each topic to be checked

    :param other_actions: An optional list of other actions to be launched along with the checker
    actions

    :param port: The port number to use for the UDP spoofer.  Tests should use
    lidar_ingetration.get_open_port() so as not to conflict with other tests that may run at the
    same time

    :param spoofer: To override the default vlp16_integration_spoofer (for the velodyne driver).
    Compliant spoofers must write "Spoofer(s) number is:' to the console when they start to
    output data

    dictionary must be part of the test_context returned by the parent generate_test_description
