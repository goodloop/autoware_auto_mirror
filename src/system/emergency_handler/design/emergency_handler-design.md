Emergency Handler {#emergency_handler}
===========

This is the design document for the `emergency_handler` package.

# Purpose / Use cases

The purpose of the `emergency_handler` is to detect the emergency state based on the input
information and to generate emergency control and state commands.

# Design

The components checks multiple sources and generates emergency
velocities/state commands with the diagnostic info.
The emergency commands are sent as long as the vehicle is stopped
or the emergency state is not present.
Also it contains the heartbeat checker (watchdog) that generates emergency state
if the `DrivingCapability` message is not received with the specified frequency.
The emergency state can be also cleared by the specific service.

## Inputs / Outputs / API / Parameters

Inputs

* `autoware_auto_system_msgs/msg/DrivingCapability` is used to determine a vehicle capabilities
* `autoware_auto_system_msgs/msg/AutowareState` is used to determine the Autoware system state.
* `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/VehicleControlCommand` is used to determine current wheels angle.
* `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/VehicleStateReport` is used to determine if the vehicle
  is in manual or autonomous mode.
* `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/VehicleOdometry` is used to calculate a current vehicle velocity.

Outputs

* `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/VehicleControlCommand` contains emergency control commands.
* `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/VehicleStateCommand` contains the vehicle state commands.
* `autoware_auto_system_msgs/msg/EmergencyMode` is used to propagate information about emergency mode.
* `autoware_auto_system_msgs/msg/HazardStatusStamped` contains details about the hazard state.
* `autoware_auto_system_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray` contains diagnostic information about the current state.

Services

* `std_srvs/srv/Trigger` (/system/clear_emergency) is used to request clear of
  the emergency state.

Parameters

* `update_rate` is a node loop frequency.
* `data_ready_timeout` determines how long the emergency handler should wait after start
  for the necessary input data. If data doesn't appear in specified time, then emergency mode is reported.
* `timeout_driving_capability` determines the maximum time between consequent, received `DrivingCapability`
  messages. If the new message doesn't appear in specified time then the emergency state is reported.
* `use_emergency_hold` determines if the emergency state should be held or not.
  If it's held then it can be cleared only by a `clear_emergency` service.
* `emergency_hazard_level` is the hazard level threshold. If the hazard level is greater or equal
  to the value of parameter then the emergency mode is reported.
* `emergency_stop_acceleration_mps2` is the value of acceleration used during the emergency stop.
* `use_parking_after_stopped` determines if the state command with parking mode should be sent
  when the vehicle is stopped in the emergency mode.
* `stopped_velocity_threshold` is a velocity threshold below which the vehicle is considered as stopped.
