2. In the console, download and extract the rosbag into the adehome.
```{bash}
> cd ~/adehome
> curl https://autoware-auto.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rosbag2/rosbag2-astuff-1-lidar-only.tar.gz | tar xz
```

3. Launch ADE
```{bash}
> cd ~/adehome/AutowareAuto
> ade --rc .aderc-lgsvl start --update --enter
```

4. In the same terminal launch the demo.
   ```{bash}
   > source /opt/AutowareAuto/setup.bash
   > ros2 launch autoware_demos localization_rosbag.launch.py
   ```
   Alternatively, the script can be launch with the `-s` flag to show more options for launching.

   ```

5. Using the Rviz tool "2D Pose Estimate" provide an initial pose estimate for localization:

Once localized, the vehicle should drive to the parking spot and then proceed to park. Once parked,
the vehicle should exit the parking spot then proceed back towards the start point.
