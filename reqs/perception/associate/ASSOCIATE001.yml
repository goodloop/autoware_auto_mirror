  **The Hungarian assigner _shall_ associate distinct object detections based on a defined cost function.**

  The Hungarian algorithm was chosen because it can take in arbitrary costs. It does, however, come with O(N^3) complexity instead of, for example, O(N log N) for Global Nearest Neighbors (GNN).
