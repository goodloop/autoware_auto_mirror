  **Euclidean point clustering _shall_ group non-ground LiDAR points into distinct object clusters.**

  Abstractly, euclidean clustering groups points into clusters such that for any two points in a cluster, there exists a chain of points also within that cluster between both points such that the projected distance between subsequent points in the chain is less than some threshold.
